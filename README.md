# entropy_experiment
"Does having uncertainty in the output distribution indicate poorer performance on benchmarks?" Constrained testing in this scenario. All of the benchmarks (3) are done in a multiple-choice format.  This is not reflective of most use cases for these models. Ensuing approach would to use LLMs as a judge (perhaps via the Gemini API).

1) conda create --name entropy_experiment python=3.12.2

Just clone the repo and hit a quick "pip install -r requirements.txt".

Ensure that you have sufficient vram for your models.
